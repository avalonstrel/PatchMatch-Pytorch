# PatchMatch-Pytorch
Patch Match implemented in Pytorch

On CPU, it takes 14s for 64*64 pixel image for 1 iteration
And can be work on GPU, I didn't test it

You can use the model by invoke the deep_patch_match function in the patch_match.py

or just run
python patch_match.py figure1 figure2 save_name
